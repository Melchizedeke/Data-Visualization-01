# Data-Visualization-01

Data visualization project for the records of students occupying the hostel blocks of the university where I currently work.

This short project was conducted using the Pandas library base visualization functionalities, the matplotlib and seaborn visualization libraries respectively.

The numpy library was also used for some basic mathematical computations.

The data for the project was manually entered in as a python dictionary which was later converted into a pandas dataframe.

The data was for six blocks of the university hostel - named as B, C, D for females and E, F, G for the males.
